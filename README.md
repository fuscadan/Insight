# NBA Smart Database

Project for Insight Data Science Fellowship.  Workout in NLP techniques for summarization and information retrieval.  The goal is to be able to
1 - summarize long-form articles that recap basketball games.
2 - have some kind of smart search functionality on the database of such articles.

## TO-DO:
- Implement fuzzy searchability on the database of historical game articles (maybe "semi-supervised passage retrieval" does the trick).
- Clean the programs in the 'nba_smart_database' folder.

## TO-DONE:
- Currently able to identify the most descriptive sentence in an ESPN basketball game long-form recap.
- Cleaned the scripts in the 'scripts' folder.
